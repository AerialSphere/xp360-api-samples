# XP360 API Demos

To load a demo in JSFiddle, use a URL like this:

https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/AerialSphere/xp360-api-samples/tree/master/00-simple-demo

Replace the directory at the end of the URL (`00-simple-demo`) with the directory name of the demo you wish to load.

If you want to embed a demo in another page, you must save it first; you can't embed directly from GitHub.
